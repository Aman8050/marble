TODO for Jan 11:

Add maps to GHNS:

Annual precipation, 
precipation Summer (June)
precipation Winder (Dec)

Annual temperature
temperature Summer (June)
temperature Winder (Dec)


Showstoppers to fix before KDE 4.0.1 / Marble 0.5.1:
====================================================

Refinement:
*** Update screenshots in the docs!

*** Create map tiles at compile time

*** Download manager fixes:
- After maps get downloaded sometimes the resolution doesn't get updated to what is has just been stored on the disc
- Implement "retry to download the tile 3 times during the current session if the tile couldn't get fetched on first try"

*** Minor Backend feature polishment:
- Create a LatLonBoundingBox
- Create a QPersistentModelIndex for MarblePlaceMarkModel items to improve speed on close up zooms.
- Make Marble have a RenderingQuality setting in ViewParams: 

* LOW: For slow hardware with different defaults ( No Relief in Atlas View, using setShowQuickAndDirty(true) for really sloppy interpolation )
* MEDIUM: Basically what we have now
* HIGH: Uses Antialiased vector lines
* PRINT: Adds some Really Slow (TM) nice stuff that are typical for printed maps: e.g. Blue antialiased coast lines for the Atlas map.

- Make Marble use different Render Settings while panning (MOVE) and after releasing the mouse (DROP).

For KDE 4.0.1 it should use MEDIUM for panning and HIGH or PRINT after the mouse button has been released

*** Fix Double Click on map (which should center the map on the point being double clicked).


- Planning and architecture: write proposals for Marble 0.6 / KDE 4.1
