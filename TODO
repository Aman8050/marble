    - Make it a Marble plugin						--


Internal structure:
 * New class MarbleMap that can paint a map on any QPainter             DONE
    - Check Apidox if there is anything missing.                        --
 * Make MarbleModel a real model and MarbleWidget a real view           ----
     Move to 4.2?  Probably...

     Move to 4.2?  Probably...
 * Layer Management Class                                               TACK
    - Split off MapTheme / DGML parsing into geodata/parser.            done
      Have a GeoDataMapTheme class that basically only includes
      those parts of the current MapTheme except for parsing.
    - Implement / move <head> features as lined out in                  done
      layermanagement.txt This should happen after the 
      QXmlStreamReader port.
 * Plugin interface (see also GeoPainter)                               TACK

    - After maps get downloaded sometimes the resolution doesn't get	--
      updated to what is has just been stored on the disc
    - Implement "retry to download the tile 3 times during the current	--
      session if the tile couldn't get fetched on first try"

User experience / Usability
 * Add a small indicator to the status bar indicates map downloads      ----
   (see explanation below)

Smaller issues
 * Make the about dialog for MarbleWidget more consistent with the      ----
   application About dialog.  Or perhaps disable it for the KDE
   version?
 * Cloud Layer                                                          STRE

   - MarbleLegendBrowser                                                --

Data
 * Evaluate the implementation of tile specifications like              ----
   - http://wiki.osgeo.org/index.php/WMS_Tiling_Client_Recommendation   --
   - http://wiki.osgeo.org/index.php/Tile_Map_Service_Specification     --

   for practical relevance and implement those bits into our client
   that make sense for us to have.



Longer Explanations for some things
================================================================

The following are longer explanations for some features so that we
don't have to explain them in the list above and thus get better
overview.


Small indicator in the status bar for downloads
-----------------------------------------------
    Downloads (should be really tiny and not obtrusive just to see
    that something is going on). Ideally the user would get a tooltip
    once he hovers that progress bar with numbers of files in the
    queue, maybe amount of data that has been downloaded during the
    session.
