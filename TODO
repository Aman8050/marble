Before KDE 4.1
----------------------------------------------------------------
 * Support to display Timezones
 * Evaluate the implementation of tile specifications like 

   http://wiki.osgeo.org/index.php/WMS_Tiling_Client_Recommendation
   http://wiki.osgeo.org/index.php/Tile_Map_Service_Specification

   for practical relevance and implement those bits into our client that 
   make sense for us to have.
