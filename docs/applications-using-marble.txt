There are some applications/applets/plasmoids using Marble. They might be
affected by changes of the Marble API.

So it is good practice to check if the following applications compile and
work after API changes:

- extragear/graphics/digikam
- playground/base/plasma/wallpapers/marble


There is this link http://techbase.kde.org/Projects/Marble/MarbleUsedBy
listing also applications not hosted in KDE svn.
