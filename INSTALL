         This file describes how to build and install Marble


NOTE: This file describes how to build Marble as a stand-alone
      application.  If you are building Marble as part of the KDE-EDU
      module, then you should instead read the file INSTALL in the top
      level directory of this module and ignore this one.  This is
      most likely ../INSTALL.


Prerequisites for building Marble are:
 - Qt 4.2 or newer
 - cmake version 2.4 or newer
 - (optional): kdelibs from the KDE subversion repositories.
    We have found that revision 670142 works fine. Note that kdelibs
    is under heavy development, and some revisions might not work.


You can build and install Marble in two different ways:

1. As a Qt-only application.
2. As a KDE application, using kdelibs and KDE based classes.

Choose one of them and read below for how to do it.

1. Build Marble as a Qt only application.

1.1 Create a build directory

Create a build directory parallel to the source directory.  Suppose
that the source directory is named 'marble'. Then create a new
directory called 'marble-build'.

1.2 Configure the build tree

Go into the build directory and type

  cmake -DQTONLY=ON ../marble

1.3 Build marble

  make

1.4 Install marble

  make install


2. Build Marble as a Qt only application.

2.1 Create a build directory

This is the same step as for a Qt-only build:

Create a build directory parallel to the source directory.  Suppose
that the source directory is named 'marble'. Then create a new
directory called 'marble-build'.

2.2 Configure the build tree

Go into the build directory and type

  cmake ../marble

From now on the steps are the same as for a Qt-only build.

2.3 Build marble

  make

2.4 Install marble

  make install
